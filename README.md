## Integration with internal website (intern)
You will need to implement internal website API, which supports following:
### /job. Depending on a POST params it should:
  * Give a new job
  * Give details about job
  * Update job status
### /printer. Depending on a POST params it should:  
  * Refresh printer healthcheck
  * Reschedule jobs

Every API call must send Username (app) and Password (token) as POST params

## Intergration with printer management device:
Printer management device will need to interact with 3djuggler in order to control the job state.
By default http server will listern on localhost:8888. Juggler supports following blocking API calls:
### /info
Gives information about current job state, printed percentage etc
### /start
Start the job
### /pause
Pause the job
### /cancel
Cancel the job
### /reshedule
Give more time before jobs gets marked as "timed out"
### /version
In order to use this functionality, you needs to compile juggler with extra flag (see [compile](https://github.com/leoleovich/3djuggler#compile) section)

## Compile
Simply run:
```
go get github.com/leoleovich/3djuggler
go build github.com/leoleovich/3djuggler
```
If you want to enable optional `/version` api - you need to build juggler with extra flag:
```
go build -ldflags "-X main.gitCommit=123" github.com/leoleovich/3djuggler
```
Where 123 is a commit hash. You don't have to use this functionality. In this case /version will simply return empty string

## How to run
In order to run juggler you will need a config file. Example of this file you can find in this repository.
Juggler also supports following
There are extra flags you may find useful:
```
  -config string
    	Main config (default "3djuggler.json")
  -log string
    	Where to log (default "/var/log/3djuggler.log")
  -verbose
    	Use verbose log output
```
